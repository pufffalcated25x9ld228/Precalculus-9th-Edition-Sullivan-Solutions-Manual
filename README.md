Mike Sullivan’s time-tested approach focuses students on the fundamental skills they need for the course: preparing for class, practicing with homework, and reviewing the concepts. In the Ninth Edition, Precalculus has evolved to meet today’s course needs, building on these hallmarks by integrating projects and other interactive learning tools for use in the classroom or online.
